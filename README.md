# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## GoNext project planning

### Core features

* Implement XState to control various visual states of the app.
*   Document the machine
* Implement components to display each given state:
*   Basic search page (Basically just logo and search bar for now)
*   Result list - displayed after a search is entered from the base page
*   Game info page - dispalyed from either base page or result list once one game is clicked
